The philosopher **Harry G. Frankfurt** offers a thought-provoking and nuanced definition of _bullshit_ in his 1986 essay, "On Bullshit." According to Frankfurt, _bullshit_ is distinct from lying and has its own unique character and purpose. Here's a summary of Frankfurt's perspective:
### Definition of Bullshit:

- **Indifference to Truth:** The hallmark of bullshit is a disregard for the truth. While a liar is concerned with the truth (to conceal or distort it), the bullshitter is indifferent to whether what they say is true or false. Their main concern is to manipulate perception or achieve some goal unrelated to the truth.
    
- **Focus on Impression Management:** The bullshitter's primary aim is to create a certain impression or achieve a desired effect. They may speak or act in ways designed to make them seem competent, knowledgeable, or credible, regardless of the actual truth.

- **Bullshit (general)** Any utterance produced where a speaker has indifference towards the truth of the utterance.

- **Hard bullshit** Bullshit produced with the intention to mislead the audience about the utterer’s agenda.

- **Soft bullshit Bullshit** produced without the intention to mislead the hearer regarding the utterer’s agenda.
### Key Contrasts:

1. **Bullshit vs. Lies:**
    - A liar knows the truth but chooses to conceal or distort it.
    - A bullshitter doesn't care whether what they say aligns with the truth—they may not even bother to ascertain it.
2. **Bullshit vs. Honesty:**
    - Honest individuals strive to align their statements with reality.
    - Bullshitters are unconcerned with this alignment and instead focus on how their statements serve their immediate objectives.

### Why is Bullshit a Problem?

- **Erosion of Truth:** Bullshit is dangerous because it undermines the value and importance of truth in communication. Over time, a culture of pervasive bullshit can erode trust and degrade the shared basis for meaningful dialogue.
    
- **Cognitive Laziness:** It promotes intellectual laziness, as it doesn't require the effort of engaging with facts or the discipline of critical thought.
    

### Frankfurt’s Cultural Critique:

Frankfurt suggests that modern society's focus on performance, branding, and self-promotion fosters an environment where bullshit flourishes. In contexts where appearances matter more than substance, bullshit becomes a tool for survival and success.

This essay has become a classic in philosophical and cultural discussions, offering a lens through which to analyze contemporary issues in politics, media, and everyday life.

"In contrast [to merely unintelligible discourse], indif-
ference to the truth is extremely dangerous. The conduct 
of civilized life, and the vitality of the institutions that are indispensable to it, depend very fundamentally on respect 
for the distinction between the true and the false. Insofar as 
the authority of this distinction is undermined by the preva-
lence of bullshit and by the mindlessly frivolous attitude 
that accepts the proliferation of bullshit as innocuous, an 
indispensable human treasure is squandered"

On Frankfurt’s view, bullshit is bullshit 
even if uttered with no intent to bullshit: if something is 
bullshit to start with, then its repetition “is bullshit as he [or 
it] repeats it, insofar as it was originated by someone who 
was unconcerned with whether what he was saying is true 
or false”
