### AI i det offentlige
Hvordan får vi AI til ikke at producere bullshit i afgørelsesbreve eg? Vi skal nok have en specialiseret model med en meget lav temperature, så vi begrænser den i at tage random things

### ChatGPT is bullshit

The problem here isn’t that large language models hal-
lucinate, lie, or misrepresent the world in some way. It’s that 
they are not designed to represent the world at all; instead, 
they are designed to convey convincing lines of text.

As Chi-
rag Shah and Emily Bender put it: “Nothing in the design 
of language models (whose training task is to predict words 
given context) is actually designed to handle arithmetic, 
temporal reasoning, etc. To the extent that they sometimes 
get the right answer to such questions is only because they 
happened to synthesize relevant strings out of what was in 
their training data. No reasoning is involved […] Similarly, 
language models are prone to making stuff up […] because 
they are not designed to express some underlying set of 
information in natural language; they are only manipulating 
the form of language” (Shah & Bender, 2022).

To lie = df. to make a believed-false statement to 
another person with the intention that the other person 
believe that statement to be true (Mahon, 2015).
