# Running the Rivals – Extended DM Notes
tags: #cotn #rivals #dmtool #structure

## 🎯 Core Issue
The rivalry mechanic in *Call of the Netherdeep* is underdeveloped. It reduces rivals to a simplistic attitude scale: **Friendly / Indifferent / Hostile** — which only governs *how* they interact, not *what* they want or do.

This leads to two common failures:
- The Rivals become **dead or irrelevant** (killed or sidelined).
- The Rivals become **GMPC allies**, making the game too easy or bloated.

---

## 🔁 Replace the Relationship Gauge with Dynamic Modes of Action

Instead of focusing on attitude, **play the Rivals like PCs**: Track what they’re trying to do and how they react to the players.

### 🎭 Rival Action Modes (Choose & Shift Over Time)
- Work in **true partnership** with PCs (rare, fragile, limited)
- **Shadow the party** believing they need help
- **Pursue the same quest independently**
- **Walk away entirely** ("This isn’t our fight")
- **Seize the Jewel and take control**, possibly through betrayal

📌 Let the Rivals naturally shift between these based on events and player choices.

---

## ⚖️ Rival Opposition > Simple Hostility

Instead of “they attack you,” use **The Principle of Opposition**:

> “Whatever the players believe is right — the Rivals believe the opposite.”

### Examples at Endgame:

| PC Choice | Rival Response |
|-----------|----------------|
| “We must free Alyxian.” | Ayo: “He’s mad! You’ll doom the world!” |
| “We should help him.” | Galsariad: “There’s no helping him. He must be destroyed.” |
| “We kill him.” | Maggie: “He’s in pain! You can’t just murder him!” |

Use **attitude** to shape how they oppose (debate, sabotage, direct attack) — but let them *always* have their own agenda.

---

## 🗣️ Agenda-Driven Campaign Structure

> "A rival must have something to compete over."

### Strengthen Rival Utility by Clarifying Campaign Goals:

**Three key questions for the players and Rivals to clash over:**

1. **What is the Jewel of Three Prayers?**  
   PCs (and Rivals) should know it can be fully awakened through specific shrines.

2. **What is Ruidium and what should be done with it?**  
   Each faction — and rival — may disagree.

3. **Who is Alyxian, and what should be done with him?**  
   Free, help, or destroy — and why?

### 🧱 Structure Goals by Chapter
- **Chapter 2**: “We must find out what’s in Bazzoxan — and why.”
- **Chapter 3-4**: “What is the connection between the relics and the Jewel?”
- **Chapter 5**: “What will we do with Alyxian’s power once it’s revealed?”

Let the **Rivals stake out different opinions** on each.

---

## 💣 Avoid These Pitfalls

### ❌ GMPC Blob
If Rivals join the party full-time:
- You now control 5 full-featured characters.
- They bloat combat, slow pacing, and distort spotlight balance.

💡 **Fix**: If players agree to work together:
- Assign off-screen missions to Rivals
- Temporarily split the party with mixed PC/rival groups
- Encourage **short-lived alliances** that break on ideological or moral grounds

### ❌ Pet Killers / Thieves
- Don’t let Rivals steal the Jewel unless *you’re ready for full war*.
- Players *will* murder them — and rightly so.

---

## 🧠 Design Philosophy

- Roleplay truthfully: Rivals are autonomous actors.
- Debate the agenda: Conflict = emotional investment.
- Let opinions clash to spark character drama.
- Elevate Alyxian’s myth *early* to fuel long-term engagement.

---

## ✅ Practical DM Tips
- Create a “Rival Action Board” or tracker in Obsidian (e.g., YAML field per session)
- Use interludes, overheard scenes, or rival POV flashbacks
- Let one rival shift toward the PCs while another radicalizes

---

_“If you ever hit a point where you don’t know what the Rivals would do, you probably haven’t defined the PCs’ goals clearly enough.”_
