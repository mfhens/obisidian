### 🧩 The Watcher's Shrine — Chamber Details

---

## **1. The Hall of Faces**

> _Statues line the walls — faceless, save for one. Its eyes glimmer with watery light, and it watches whoever enters._

**Description**:

- The air is cold and still. A soft humming noise fills the chamber but seems to stop whenever someone speaks.
    
- The intact statue depicts a genderless figure in monastic robes. Its gaze seems to follow the PCs.
    

**Mechanics**:

- A character can stare into the statue’s eyes. They must succeed a **DC 14 Intelligence saving throw** or gain a **temporary flaw**:  
    _"I believe I’m being watched at all times."_
    
- Success grants a **fragmented vision of Alyxian’s past**, which can be roleplayed or revealed via whisper:
    
    > _You see Alyxian fall to his knees on a blood-soaked battlefield. Behind him, a divine eye opens in the sky — and blinks._
    

**Optional Discovery**:

- Investigating the statue’s base reveals a glyph in **Deep Speech**: “THEY WATCH BACK.”
    
The statue’s eyes in **Room 1** are slightly moist, and staring into them for a prolonged moment (10+ seconds) causes the viewer to hear a faint voice:

> _"Show it what you hide inside. Let it taste what you would bleed for."_

- This whisper could be heard by only one PC, fostering paranoia or urgency.
    
- If multiple players try again, the voice may change its message based on their alignment or past sins.
---

## **2. The Reflection Pool**

> _Cracked stone surrounds a circular basin filled with oily black water. It does not reflect the room — only you._

**Interaction**:

- The pool requires an offering of **1d4 HP worth of blood**. When a character bleeds into it, they see not themselves — but a distorted _future self_.
    
- This form represents their **worst fear, flaw, or obsession**, visualized as a brief hallucination or vision.
    

**Boons**:

- The player may ask a single question (like _divination_) to the DM, answered cryptically from Alyxian's fractured mind.
    
- Add tension: the more personal the question, the clearer the answer.
    

**Drawback**:

- The character takes **1d6 psychic damage**, as Alyxian’s anguish lashes out.

## **3. The Mural of Divergence**

> _A long, crumbling fresco shows two groups: one entering flame, one shadow. Both hold identical relics._

**Inspection**:

- **DC 13 Insight**: “The figures aren’t enemies — but neither are they allies. The two paths diverge… yet neither leads to peace.”
    
- **Arcana (DC 15)**: Reveals planar energy marks. The mural depicts **alternate destinies**, implying the Alyxian story may play out more than once — with different heroes.
    

**Moral Choice**:

- Players may touch the mural. Doing so causes a surge of _fate-charged energy_:
    
    - One character feels _chosen_, gains **+1 to Insight checks until next long rest**.
        
    - Another feels _doubt_, takes **disadvantage on Charisma checks vs rivals** for the same duration.

## 👁️‍🗨️ Sorrowsworn: The Lost

_(Aberration, Medium, Neutral Evil — corrupted echo of the Betrayer Gods’ aftermath)_

> **“It seeks what was taken. It mourns what was broken. And it will never, ever let go.”**

---

### **Lore (for you as DM)**

The Echo of the Unseen is a **manifestation of trauma**, left behind in the Watcher’s Shrine by those who glimpsed Alyxian’s fractured fate and could not bear it.

These creatures are shaped by the **fear of abandonment** and the **pain of forgotten duties** — and they latch on to anyone who walks the same path of regret.

This particular echo calls out with **familiar voices** — taking on the tone and shape of loved ones or rivals.

## **Traits**

### 🧠 **Echoed Voice**

The Lost mimics the voice of someone important to each creature within 60 ft. Whenever a creature starts its turn within this range, it must succeed on a **DC 14 Wisdom saving throw** or have **disadvantage on attack rolls** against the Lost until the end of its next turn.

> _“You let me die...”_

---

### 👣 **Cling to Life**

When a creature within 30 ft. is reduced to 0 HP but not killed outright, the Lost may use its reaction to **move up to its speed** toward the target and make a **grasping attack** (see below).

---

## **Actions**

### 🪓 **Multiattack**

The Lost makes two Grasping Claw attacks.

---

### ✋ **Grasping Claw**

_Melee Weapon Attack_: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.  
_Hit_: **13 (2d8 + 4) psychic damage**, and the target must succeed on a **DC 14 Strength saving throw** or be **grappled (escape DC 14)**.

> While grappled, the target hears constant whispers of regret and cannot take reactions.

---

### 💢 **Wave of Despair** _(Recharge 5–6)_

The Lost unleashes a pulse of corrupted anguish in a 30 ft. radius.

- All creatures must succeed on a **DC 14 Wisdom saving throw** or take **22 (5d8) psychic damage** and fall prone.
    
- On a success: half damage, no knockdown.
    

> Creatures affected hear a moment from Alyxian’s past — something _intensely personal_ to _them_, even if impossible.

---

## **Legendary Flare (Optional)**

If used as a boss in the Watcher's Shrine, consider:

### 🔥 Lair Trait: “Eyes That Do Not Close”

The shrine pulses with old divinity. At initiative count 20, one of the following effects occurs (DM’s choice or roll):

1. **All light sources extinguish.** For 1 round, only creatures with darkvision can see.
    
2. **Walls shift subtly.** Movement is halved for 1 round.
    
3. **The pool trembles.** One random creature hears a scream and takes **1d6 psychic damage**, no save.
