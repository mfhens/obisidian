## 📘 Prolix Yusaf — Allegiance of Allsight

_"If we do not study power, others will misuse it."_

| Hook                          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🏛️ **Crematorium Logistics** | Prolix is arguing with a crematorium operator about using heat readings from the furnaces to analyze ruidium decay patterns in bodies. The operator is creeped out.                                                         |
| 🧪 **Field Lecture**          | PCs pass a crowd of curious goblinoids — Prolix is giving an impromptu lecture on “sub-crystalline behavior under Abyssal stress.” Insight check reveals he’s clearly avoiding talking about ethical concerns.              |
| 🧭 **Survey Clash**           | The party stumbles into a heated dispute between Prolix and a Cael Morrow veteran about territorial claims on an unearthed ruidium node. He asks the PCs to help document the site “before the Consortium twists the data.” |
| 🐜 **Autopsy Request**        | Prolix is trying to persuade a local soldier to give up a ruidium-tainted monster corpse. If the PCs offer assistance or access, he’s deeply grateful — and chatty.                                                         |

## 🧨 Aloysia Telfan — Consortium of the Vermilion Dream

_"Secrets are more valuable than gold. Especially if you're the only one who knows them."_

|Hook|Description|
|---|---|
|🎯 **Watching You**|As the PCs leave a ruin, they spot someone tailing them. Aloysia approaches moments later and casually reveals what they found, having already observed them. “Information is my game. And you’re interesting.”|
|💼 **Rivalry Game**|She intercepts the party to gossip about Prolix. “He's smart, but stuck in a library mindset.” Offers ruidium powder in exchange for a favor — or a distraction.|
|🩸 **Wounded but Smiling**|PCs spot her getting stitched up in the infirmary. She insists on continuing her own treatment — using a ruidium-tipped needle. “Just a little edge.”|
|🧵 **Underground Bidding War**|At a side market, Aloysia is haggling with a drow fence over a ruidium artifact. She offers the PCs a deal: outbid him using a pouch of platinum she slides across the table. “Prove you’re useful.”|

## 📚 Question — Library of the Cobalt Soul

_"Truth is the greatest good. But truth is rarely comfortable."_

|Hook|Description|
|---|---|
|🎗️ **The Wall of the Unforgotten**|PCs find Question writing names on the memorial wall, hands trembling. If approached, she mentions losing three contacts to ruidium corruption. “It doesn’t just kill the body.”|
|🔎 **Silent Witness**|PCs notice her observing them from a balcony or side street — not hidden, just… watching. When approached, she apologizes and asks, “Have you felt any changes? Since the vision?”|
|🕯️ **Vigil Ritual**|At a small temple, Question is leading a silent vigil. Insight reveals she is wrestling with orders to _spy_ on the Allegiance’s ruidium efforts. She invites the PCs to share burdens.|
|📘 **Loose Page in the Wind**|PCs find a torn journal page warning of “memory fractures” in ruidium victims. Later, Question finds them and asks — did they read it? “Then you know what I fear.”|

### 🎯 Bonus: Group-Level Encounter Hooks

These scenarios introduce all three researchers indirectly, making the party choose whom to follow or help.


Here are **dynamic NPC templates** for the three researchers in _Call of the Netherdeep_ Chapter 3, styled using **universal NPC roleplay prep** principles:

- **What do they want?**
    
- **How do they act?**
    
- **What secrets are they hiding?**
    
- **How do they react to the PCs and Rivals?**
    
- **What do they offer?**
    
- **How do they escalate?**
    

Each includes roleplay hooks and mechanical levers to deepen engagement and highlight faction philosophies.
