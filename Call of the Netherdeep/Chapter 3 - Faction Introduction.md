## ✅ 1. **Faction Identity Snapshot**

Here’s how to present each faction’s identity and ruidium philosophy in a way that’s clear and differentiated for the players:

|Faction|Identity Summary|Ruidium Philosophy|Player Hook|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Allegiance of Allsight**|Enlightenment-through-control academic order, like a magical imperial university|Ruidium is a powerful tool. If controlled, it can be harnessed for defense, arcane advancement, and national power|“We can protect people if we understand and weaponize this first.”|
|**Consortium of the Vermilion Dream**|Arcane black-market guild obsessed with secrets and esoterica; elitist|Ruidium is a once-in-an-age discovery. Hoard it, master it, **never share it**|“You’ve seen what it can do. Now imagine what _we_ could do — before someone else does.”|
|**Cobalt Soul**|Monastic knowledge seekers devoted to truth and transparency|Ruidium is inherently corruptive and must be **eliminated** from the world|“No matter your intention, this thing will rot you. We’ve seen it before.”|

**Design Tip**: Anchor these philosophies in terms of risk vs. reward and ethical outlook. That will help your players decide who they align with (or oppose).

## ✅ 2. **Show, Don’t Tell: NPC Vignettes & Clue Drops**

### Researcher Behaviors in Bazzoxan

Let each NPC **embody** their faction’s values without needing to monologue about them. Here are suggestions:

---

### 🧠 **Prolix Yusaf** (Allegiance of Allsight)

- **Approach**: Respectful, cautious, and slightly officious. Offers technical analyses of ruidium sites.
    
- **Behavioral Hook**: Carries out a controlled detonation of a ruidium fragment inside a sealed rune box and quietly records the data. Notes that “practical applications could be immense — especially for defense.”
    
- **Moral Dilemma**: May ask the PCs to help him **harvest ruidium from a corrupted body**, saying, “The decay is regrettable, but we need samples before it disappears.”
    

---

### 🔮 **Aloysia Telfan** (Consortium of the Vermilion Dream)

- **Approach**: Seductive, secretive, maybe even too friendly. Believes PCs can be useful tools.
    
- **Behavioral Hook**: Offers a vial of powdered ruidium as payment, claiming “it bends time to your will.” Winks, “Don’t ask where it came from.”
    
- **Moral Dilemma**: Wants the PCs to break into Prolix’s tent and steal research notes: “Let’s say... we're not always first to the site. But we can be the best at understanding it.”
    

---

### 📚 **Question** (Cobalt Soul)

- **Approach**: Sincere, humble, wounded. Trying to do the right thing in a broken system.
    
- **Behavioral Hook**: Distributes pamphlets warning of ruidium corruption. Genuinely asks PCs, “Do you feel anything… off since the Grotto?”
    
- **Moral Dilemma**: Reveals she **burned an entire shipment of ruidium samples** rather than risk them falling into the wrong hands.

## ✅ 3. **Factions as Campaign Vectors**

The goal isn’t just for the players to _know_ the factions — it’s to feel like they could:

- Join them
    
- Spy on them
    
- Sabotage them
    
- Exploit them
    

So give the factions:

- **Opposing goals** (even within Betrayers’ Rise: e.g., sample collection vs. sanctity protection)
    
- **Overlapping contacts** (e.g., the same guide is working with both Question and Aloysia)
    
- **Early asks** (small favors: deliver a scroll, carry a sample, make an observation…)
    

And then raise the stakes.
