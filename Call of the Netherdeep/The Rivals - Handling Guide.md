## 🔧 Key Strategies

### 🧱 1. Mechanical Survivability
> “Don’t let dice kill your narrative.”

- Rivals at 0 HP are **unconscious**, not dead (unless explicitly executed).
- Use **Dermot** or divine echoes to stabilize dying rivals off-screen.
- Rivals **retreat** if losing, preferring to survive and regroup.

---

### 🤝 2. Limit Cooperation
> “Allies? Maybe. But never teammates.”

- Allow **temporary alliances** only for mutual survival.
- Cooperation should cause **friction** (e.g., reward disputes, mission overlap).
- Limit shared combat to **single encounters** unless narratively justified.

#### Sample Rule:
> “The rivals will never stand side-by-side with the PCs for more than one full combat unless something massive changes.”

### 🎭 3. Shared Influence on Alyxian
> “If one group fails to redeem him, the other might succeed—or doom him.”

- Both parties can **influence visions and dreams**.
- Let PCs discover that **rivals are receiving their own version** of the visions.
- Use this to create thematic symmetry and competition.

---

### 🎲 4. Conflict Without Combat
> Tension is best when it doesn’t rely on hit points.

- Use rumors, NPCs, and divine visions to **reflect rival motivations**.
- Show rivals making **independent progress** or claiming artifacts first.
- Include cutscenes, overheard conversations, or revealed letters.

Track each rival's attitude using this scale:

|-------|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| +2    | Friendly Rivals   | Might assist in battle, still self-interested |
| +1    | Cordial Tension   | Trade info, race for objectives               |
| 0     | Wary Competition  | Avoidance, occasional sabotage                |
| -1    | Active Saboteurs  | Undermine PC actions, discredit party         |
| -2    | Hostile Rivals    | Potential for direct conflict                 |
