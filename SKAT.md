### Tre Scenarier
- Keep fixing what is broken (what UFST does today)
- One COTS
- "Best of breed" with multiple COTS => Building a Danish Tax Platform
### **Proposed Next Steps**

1. **Immediate Focus Areas**:
    
    - Develop a compliance strategy for OECD BEPS Pillar Two rules.
    - Evaluate readiness for implementing VAT e-invoicing and digital reporting requirements, leveraging recommendations from _VAT in the Digital Age_.
2. **Technology Modernization**:
    
    - Use IMF guidelines to audit existing IT infrastructure and initiate COTS implementation or system upgrades.
    - Prioritize interoperability to align with the OECD Tax Administration 3.0 vision.
3. **Stakeholder Engagement**:
    
    - Conduct workshops with businesses and policymakers to align reforms with both _Minimum Tax Implementation_ and VAT system changes.
    - Build governance structures based on IMF program management recommendations.
    -

Here are two alternative approaches to implementing the system landscape for the Danish Tax Authority, beyond a COTS solution:

---

## **1. Custom-Built System**

A fully tailored solution developed in-house or by external contractors to meet the unique needs of the Danish Tax Authority.

### **Advantages**:

- **Full Customization**:
    - Aligns directly with Denmark's specific tax types, policies, and operational workflows (e.g., VAT, DAC directives, BEPS compliance).
- **Adaptability**:
    - Easy to integrate with existing systems like Omada, Camunda, and ZRB while tailoring workflows for future needs.
- **Ownership**:
    - Provides long-term control over the system, avoiding vendor lock-in.

### **Challenges**:

- **High Initial Cost**:
    - Development, testing, and deployment can be expensive and time-consuming.
- **Maintenance Burden**:
    - Requires dedicated resources for upgrades, bug fixes, and regulatory changes.
- **Scalability Risk**:
    - May struggle to scale as requirements evolve compared to pre-tested COTS scalability.

### **Recommended Approach**:

- **Agile Development**:
    - Adopt an agile methodology with iterative releases to reduce risks and deliver core functionalities early.
- **Microservices Architecture**:
    - Build modular components (e.g., tax calculation, compliance, reporting) to allow independent development and easier updates.
- **Open Standards**:
    - Use APIs and open standards for seamless integration and interoperability with EU-wide and global systems.

## **2. Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)**

Leverage cloud-based platforms (e.g., Microsoft Azure, AWS, or Google Cloud) to build and operate a flexible system.

### **Advantages**:

- **Cost Efficiency**:
    - Reduces infrastructure investment by utilizing pay-as-you-go models.
- **Rapid Deployment**:
    - Accelerates development using pre-built components (e.g., database services, machine learning models, and identity management).
- **Scalability**:
    - Automatically scales with demand, ensuring capacity during tax season or large-scale operations.
- **Compliance-Ready**:
    - Many platforms come pre-certified for standards like SOC 2, ISO 27001, and GDPR compliance.

### **Challenges**:

- **Vendor Dependence**:
    - Risk of reliance on a single cloud provider.
- **Customizability Limits**:
    - May not fully support Denmark-specific regulations and tax workflows out of the box.
- **Data Sovereignty**:
    - Strict requirements for tax data hosting and processing within the EU may limit some PaaS providers.

### **Recommended Approach**:

- **Hybrid Cloud Deployment**:
    - Combine private and public clouds for sensitive data storage (private) and scalable workloads (public).
- **Low-Code Development**:
    - Utilize low-code platforms to rapidly develop tax management workflows while allowing customization where necessary.
- **Modular Build**:
    - Start with critical modules (e.g., VAT compliance, taxpayer registration) and incrementally expand to others.

## **Comparison of Alternatives**

|**Criteria**|**Custom-Built System**|**PaaS Solution**|
|---|---|---|
|**Initial Cost**|High|Medium|
|**Time to Market**|Long|Short|
|**Scalability**|Medium|High|
|**Customization**|High|Medium|
|**Maintenance**|Internal resources required|Offloaded to the platform|
|**Vendor Lock-in**|None|Risk of lock-in with a provider|

## **Recommended Use Cases**

1. **Custom-Built**:
    
    - When Denmarkâ€™s tax workflows, rules, and compliance requirements demand unique features not easily supported by existing platforms.
    - For long-term projects with sufficient resources and in-house expertise.
2. **PaaS**:
    
    - When rapid deployment and cost-efficiency are critical.
    - To experiment with new digital tools like AI-driven fraud detection or blockchain-based tax workflows, using cloud-native capabilities.
